# NestedNavCompose

This component provides a powerful and flexible navigation experience within your application. It combines three key elements:

1. Nested Navigation: Imagine your app has sections like Home, Profile, and Settings. Each section can have its navigation flow within itself. This component allows you to create separate "nested graphs" for each section, enabling focused and organized navigation.

2. Multiple Back Stacks: Each nested graph maintains its back stack. This means users can navigate back through each section independently, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.

3. Navigation Bottom: This component typically displays a bottom bar with buttons representing different sections of your app. It provides a convenient way for users to navigate between these sections, even if they are deep within a nested navigation flow.
